# EZRecolor
## A Unity shader that makes recoloring textures easy and that can bake them into rasterized textures
This shader was initially made for my avatars, such as the [Avigen](https://mikedabird.itch.io/avigen) and the [Mike'Vali](https://mikedabird.itch.io/mikevali)

Using Black & White masks, the EZRecolor shader allows to recolor a material in all kinds of ways without touching a single photo editing software!

It also includes a Baker window, under "Mike Da Bird > EZRecolor > Texture Baker" to bake EZRecolor materials into reusable textures (for use cases not supporting Unity custom shaders) Simply select the avatar, drop the EZRecolor prefab you want to use and let it bake!

Right now, the Mike'Vali and Rayvian avatar bases are supported plus general material baking. Avigen avatar base is coming soon!
